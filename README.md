# Floor Mats Calculator App

I developed a simple and practical app using Python with **KivyMD** that calculates how many floor mats are required to cover a specific area, like a bedroom, living room, or any other space.

## Features

- **Easy Input**: The app allows users to enter room dimensions and quickly get an accurate count of mats needed.
- **Convenience**: Saves users from manual calculations, ensuring they purchase the right amount for their room size.
- **Unique Design**: I created the artwork for the app, giving it a unique and personalized look, combining functionality with style.

This tool offers both **convenience and style**, making it easier for users to plan their space efficiently and with a personal touch.

## Test Environments

- **Python 3.10**: Passed all tests successfully.
- **Python 3.7**: Encountered issues with KivyMD installation.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python interlockingfloormat.py
```
