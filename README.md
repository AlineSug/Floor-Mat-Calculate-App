I developed a simple and practical app using Python with KivyMD
that calculates how many floor mats are required to cover a specific area, like a bedroom, living room, or any other space.
The app simplifies the process by allowing users to input room dimensions and quickly receive an accurate count of mats needed.
This tool is convenient and saves users the hassle of manual calculations, ensuring they purchase the amount required for their room size.
I also created the app's artwork, giving it a unique and personalized look. 
This tool offers convenience and style, making it easier for users to plan their space efficiently and with a personalized touch.
